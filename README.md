# cpe400-networking-project

* AUTHORS: Aaron Mcanerney, Nikkolas Irwin, and Anthony Bennett

* DESCRIPTION: Simulates a mesh network where nodes and links may fail. Nodes and links may fail intermittently. As an input to the simulation, each node and link will have a certain probability to fail. When such failure occurs, the network must adapt and re-route to avoid the faulty link/node.
